      "name": "Support & Response",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What are your standard response times?",
          "answer": "For Severity 1 (business down) incidents, we respond within 30 minutes, 24/7. Severity 2 issues get a response within 2 hours during business hours. Standard requests are acknowledged within 4 business hours and resolved based on priority."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I contact support?",
          "answer": "You can reach us via our client portal (preferred for tracking), email at support@quantumharbour.ie, or phone for urgent issues. Severity 1 incidents should always be called in to ensure immediate response."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide on-site support?",
          "answer": "Yes. Our Proactive Plan includes on-site support during business hours when required. Enterprise clients get priority on-site response. On-site visits are also available ad-hoc for Reactive Plan clients at our standard hourly rate."
        },
        {
          "question": "What hours is your support team available?",
          "answer": "Our helpdesk operates 8am-6pm Monday to Friday for general support. Proactive and Enterprise clients have access to out-of-hours support for critical issues. Our monitoring systems run 24/7/365 and will alert us to critical problems regardless of time."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Pricing & Contracts",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How is pricing calculated?",
          "answer": "We price per user, per month. A 'user' is anyone who needs IT support — whether full-time, part-time, or contractor. This keeps pricing simple and predictable as your team changes."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are there any setup fees?",
          "answer": "For straightforward environments, there's no setup fee — we absorb onboarding costs. Complex migrations, legacy system cleanups, or environments requiring significant remediation may have a one-time project fee, which we'll quote transparently upfront."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the minimum contract length?",
          "answer": "Our standard agreement is 12 months, which gives us time to properly stabilise and optimise your environment. We offer month-to-month after the initial term. We're confident you'll want to stay."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if we need to add or remove users?",
          "answer": "Easy — just let us know. Billing adjusts the following month. We don't lock you into user counts, and there's no penalty for reducing headcount."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you support contractors or only full-time staff?",
          "answer": "We price per supported user, regardless of employment type. If they need IT support and access to your systems, they count as a user."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Security & Compliance",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "How do you handle our sensitive data?",
          "answer": "We follow strict data handling procedures aligned with ISO 27001 best practices. Our staff are background-checked, we use encrypted connections for all remote access, and we maintain detailed audit logs. Your data stays yours — we're custodians, not owners."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you help with compliance requirements?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We have experience with GDPR, healthcare data protection, PCI-DSS, and various industry-specific requirements. We can provide compliance documentation, implement required controls, and support you through audits."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if there's a security breach?",
          "answer": "We have documented incident response procedures. We'll contain the threat, investigate the root cause, notify you immediately, help with any regulatory reporting requirements, and implement measures to prevent recurrence. Our EDR tools also provide forensic data for investigation."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide security awareness training?",
          "answer": "Yes, it's included in all our plans. We provide monthly phishing simulations, an online learning portal, and regular security awareness updates. We can also run targeted training for high-risk roles."
        }

    },
    {
      "name": "Technical & Services",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What systems and software do you support?",
          "answer": "We primarily support Windows environments, Microsoft 365, and common business applications. We also support Mac endpoints and can manage Linux servers. If you have specific line-of-business applications, we'll work with those vendors on your behalf."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you take over from our current IT provider?",
          "answer": "Yes, we handle provider transitions regularly. We'll coordinate with your existing provider, ensure proper handover of documentation and credentials, and manage the transition to minimise disruption."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you provide hardware?",
          "answer": "Yes, through our Hardware as a Service (HaaS) offering. You lease hardware on a predictable monthly cost, and we handle procurement, setup, and lifecycle management. This is available as an add-on to any plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's included in your backup service?",
          "answer": "We back up endpoints, servers, and cloud data (Microsoft 365, etc.) with encrypted storage both locally and in the cloud. Critically, we perform regular test restores to verify backups actually work — not just that they exist."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you support multiple office locations?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We currently support clients across Ireland and the UK with multi-site operations. Our remote management tools work regardless of location, and we can coordinate on-site support at any location."
        }

    {
      "name": "Getting Started",
      "faqs": [
        {
          "question": "What does onboarding look like?",
          "answer": "We start with a discovery call to understand your environment and needs. Then we conduct a free IT audit to assess your current state. From there, we propose a plan, and if you proceed, we execute a structured onboarding over 2-4 weeks depending on complexity."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does it take to get fully set up?",
          "answer": "Typically 2-4 weeks from contract signing to full managed services coverage. We prioritise getting monitoring and security tools deployed first, then roll out remaining components systematically."
        },
        {
          "question": "What do you need from us to get started?",
          "answer": "Initially, just time for a discovery conversation. For onboarding, we'll need admin credentials to your systems, documentation your current provider has (if any), and introductions to key stakeholders. We'll guide you through exactly what's needed."
