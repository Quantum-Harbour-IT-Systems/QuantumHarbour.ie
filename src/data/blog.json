      "excerpt": "Ransomware attacks on Irish businesses increased 40% last year. Here's what you need to know to protect your organisation — and what to do if you're hit.",
      "content": "Ransomware continues to be the number one cyber threat facing Irish businesses. In this post, we break down how modern ransomware works, why SMEs are increasingly targeted, and the practical steps you can take today to reduce your risk.\n\n## Why SMEs Are Targets\n\nContrary to popular belief, cybercriminals don't just go after big corporations. SMEs are attractive targets because they often have:\n\n- Valuable data but weaker security\n- Less IT expertise in-house\n- Higher likelihood of paying ransoms\n- Connections to larger supply chains\n\n## The Modern Attack Chain\n\nToday's ransomware attacks typically follow this pattern:\n\n1. **Initial Access** — Usually via phishing email or compromised credentials\n2. **Persistence** — Attackers establish backdoors and disable security tools\n3. **Lateral Movement** — They spread across your network, looking for valuable data\n4. **Exfiltration** — Data is stolen before encryption (for double extortion)\n5. **Encryption** — Files are encrypted and ransom demanded\n\n## What You Can Do Today\n\n### 1. Implement Proper Backups\n- Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite\n- Test restores regularly — backups you can't restore are worthless\n- Keep backups isolated from your main network\n\n### 2. Enable MFA Everywhere\n- Microsoft 365, VPNs, banking, everything\n- Use authenticator apps, not SMS where possible\n- No exceptions for executives\n\n### 3. Train Your People\n- Regular phishing simulations\n- Clear reporting procedures\n- Make it safe to report mistakes\n\n### 4. Patch Promptly\n- Critical security updates within 48 hours\n- Automated patching where possible\n- Don't forget network equipment and firmware\n\n## If You're Hit\n\n1. **Don't panic** — but act quickly\n2. **Isolate affected systems** — unplug from network\n3. **Don't pay immediately** — you may have options\n4. **Call your IT provider and insurer** — they've seen this before\n5. **Preserve evidence** — you may need it for law enforcement\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nRansomware is a when-not-if threat for most businesses. The good news is that basic security hygiene stops the vast majority of attacks. The question is whether you'll invest in prevention or pay the much higher cost of recovery.",

      "title": "Why Backup Testing Matters More Than Backups",
      "excerpt": "Everyone says they have backups. But when did you last test a restore? The uncomfortable truth is that untested backups are just hope with extra steps.",
      "content": "Here's a conversation we have too often: 'Do you have backups?' 'Yes, of course.' 'When did you last test a restore?' '...'\n\n## The Uncomfortable Truth\n\nBackups that haven't been tested are just assumptions. And those assumptions have a nasty habit of failing at the worst possible moment.\n\nWe've seen it all:\n- Backups running successfully for months — to a full disk that stopped accepting writes\n- Database backups that were consistent but missing transaction logs needed for recovery\n- File backups excluding the one folder that actually mattered\n- Successful backups with no documented (or tested) restore procedure\n\n## What Good Backup Testing Looks Like\n\n### Monthly: Spot Checks\n- Pick random files and restore them\n- Verify the content is correct and recent\n- Document what you tested and the results\n\n### Quarterly: Full System Restore\n- Restore a complete server or workstation to isolated hardware\n- Boot it up and verify applications work\n- Time the process — know your actual RTO\n\n### Annually: Full DR Test\n- Simulate a complete site failure\n- Restore operations from backup infrastructure\n- Involve business stakeholders, not just IT\n\n## The Compliance Angle\n\nMost compliance frameworks now explicitly require backup testing, not just backups. GDPR, for instance, requires that you can demonstrate data can be 'restored in a timely manner.' You can't demonstrate that without testing.\n\n## Start Today\n\nIf you can't remember your last backup test, that's your sign. Start with something simple: pick five random files from your backup and restore them. Can you find them? Can you restore them? How long does it take?\n\nThat's your baseline. Build from there.",

      "excerpt": "The term 'managed services' gets thrown around a lot. But what does an MSP actually do day-to-day? Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how we work.",
      "content": "When we tell people we're a managed service provider, we often get a polite nod followed by 'so... you fix computers?' Well, yes. But also much more than that.\n\n## The Shift from Break-Fix to Managed\n\nTraditionally, IT support was reactive: something breaks, you call someone, they fix it, you pay per hour. This model has obvious problems:\n\n- No incentive to prevent problems\n- Unpredictable costs\n- Downtime while waiting for help\n- No strategic guidance\n\nManaged services flip this model. You pay a predictable monthly fee, and we take responsibility for keeping your IT running. Our incentive is now aligned with yours: the fewer problems, the better for everyone.\n\n## What We Actually Do\n\n### Proactive Monitoring (24/7)\n- Every device reports health metrics continuously\n- We see problems forming before they cause downtime\n- Automated alerts for disk space, memory, security events\n- We often fix issues before you know they existed\n\n### Patch Management\n- Security updates deployed systematically\n- Tested before deployment to avoid breaking things\n- Critical patches prioritised and tracked\n- Compliance reporting on patch status\n\n### Security Operations\n- Endpoint protection management\n- Email security and filtering\n- Dark web monitoring for credential leaks\n- Security awareness training\n- Incident response when needed\n\n### Backup Management\n- Configure and monitor backups\n- Regular test restores (not just hoping it works)\n- Disaster recovery planning and testing\n\n### Helpdesk Support\n- Day-to-day user support\n- Password resets, software installs, troubleshooting\n- New user onboarding and offboarding\n- Vendor liaison for third-party applications\n\n### Strategic Guidance\n- Quarterly business reviews\n- Technology roadmap planning\n- Budget recommendations\n- Project planning and execution\n\n## The Result\n\nOur clients get enterprise-grade IT operations without needing an enterprise-sized IT team. Predictable costs, fewer emergencies, and a partner who actually understands their business.\n\nThat's what a managed service provider does.",

      "excerpt": "Multi-factor authentication is the single most effective security control you can implement. Here's why it needs to be everywhere — including for your CEO.",
      "content": "If there's one security recommendation we make more than any other, it's this: enable multi-factor authentication everywhere.\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\nMicrosoft's data shows that MFA blocks 99.9% of automated attacks. Google's internal data is similar. This isn't marketing — it's just math. Even if an attacker has your password, they can't log in without the second factor.\n\n## Why Passwords Alone Fail\n\nPasswords fail for predictable reasons:\n\n- **Reuse**: People use the same password everywhere\n- **Phishing**: Convincing fakes steal credentials daily\n- **Breaches**: Password databases leak constantly\n- **Weak choices**: Despite policies, people pick bad passwords\n\nMFA doesn't fix these problems — it makes them irrelevant. Even a stolen password is useless without the second factor.\n\n## Where to Enable MFA\n\nThe short answer: everywhere that supports it.\n\nThe specific answer:\n- Microsoft 365 / Google Workspace (mandatory)\n- Banking and financial systems\n- VPN and remote access\n- Password managers (yes, really)\n- Social media accounts\n- Domain registrars\n- Any system with sensitive data\n\n## The Executive Exception Problem\n\nWe often hear: 'Can we exclude the CEO? He finds it annoying.'\n\nNo. Absolutely not. Executives are the highest-value targets for attackers. Their accounts have the most access, their emails are the most convincing for fraud, and their calendars reveal sensitive information.\n\nIf anything, executives need stricter security, not exemptions.\n\n## Making MFA Bearable\n\nMFA doesn't have to be painful:\n\n- **Use authenticator apps**, not SMS (more secure and often faster)\n- **Enable 'remember this device'** for trusted machines\n- **Consider hardware keys** for high-security accounts\n- **Deploy conditional access** so MFA only prompts when needed\n\n## Start Today\n\nIf you haven't enabled MFA on your Microsoft 365 tenant, stop reading and go do it now. It's the highest-impact security improvement you can make, and it's essentially free.\n\nNo exceptions.",

      "excerpt": "Not all MSPs are created equal. Here's what to look for — and what red flags to avoid — when choosing an IT partner for your business.",
      "content": "Choosing a managed service provider is a significant decision. You're trusting them with your business operations, your data, and your security. Here's how to make that choice wisely.\n\n## What to Look For\n\n### 1. Clear, Predictable Pricing\n- Per-user pricing is standard and fairest\n- Understand what's included vs. extra\n- No hidden fees or surprise charges\n- Get it in writing\n\n### 2. Relevant Experience\n- Do they understand your industry?\n- Can they provide references from similar clients?\n- How long have they been in business?\n\n### 3. Robust Security Practices\n- What security tools do they use?\n- How do they handle their own security?\n- Are staff background-checked?\n- What happens in a security incident?\n\n### 4. Documented Processes\n- How do they onboard new clients?\n- What's their change management process?\n- How do they handle escalations?\n\n### 5. Good Communication\n- Do they explain things clearly?\n- Are they responsive during the sales process?\n- Do they listen or just pitch?\n\n## Red Flags\n\n### Vague Pricing\n'It depends' is fine for some questions. But if they can't give you a clear pricing structure, expect surprises.\n\n### No Standardisation\nIf every client gets a completely different setup, you're paying for them to figure it out. Good MSPs have proven, repeatable processes.\n\n### Overselling\nIf they're promising to fix everything immediately or suggesting your current setup is a disaster, be skeptical. Good partners are honest about what's realistic.\n\n### Poor Security Posture\nIf they don't take their own security seriously — no MFA, shared credentials, outdated systems — how will they handle yours?\n\n### No Backup Testing\nAsk: 'How do you verify backups work?' If the answer isn't clear and specific, walk away.\n\n## Questions to Ask\n\n1. What's included in your standard service, and what costs extra?\n2. What happens if I need to leave — how do you handle transitions?\n3. Can I speak to current clients in my industry?\n4. How do you handle security incidents?\n5. When did you last test a full disaster recovery?\n6. What certifications does your team hold?\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe cheapest option is rarely the best, but neither is the most expensive. Look for a partner who understands your business, communicates clearly, and has the processes to deliver consistent service.\n\nTake your time. This relationship will last years.",
